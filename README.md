**Description:** 

The project aimed to analyze the New York housing market by evaluating property data such as area, address, number of rooms, and dealers to identify pricing trends and demand patterns. Using SQL, I ran queries to extract key insights, and then created detailed reports and presentations in PowerPoint and Word to communicate findings. These insights helped refine marketing strategies and supported informed investment and dealer decisions.

**Tools Used:** 

SQL | MS PowerPoint
